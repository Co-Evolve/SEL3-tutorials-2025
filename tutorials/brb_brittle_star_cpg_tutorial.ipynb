    "## Central Pattern Generators\n",
    "Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are neural circuits that produce rhythmic patterned outputs without requiring rhythmic input. The term 'central' indicates that sensory feedback (from the peripheral nervous system) is not needed for generating the rhythms. This intrinsic capability to produce rhythmic patterns is essential for many basic life functions such as chewing, breathing, and digesting. They are also fundamental building blocks for the locomotor neural circuits both in invertebrate and vertebrate animals. CPGs present several interesting properties such as distributed control, the ability to deal with redundancies, fast control loops, and allowing modulation of the rhythmic patterns with simple control signals. These properties make CPGs interesting building blocks for locomotion controllers in robotics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two primary approaches are prevalent in the implementation of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) in robotics: the connectionist approach and the differential equations approach. Both rely on the creation of a nonlinear dynamical system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connectionist approach involves creating CPGs through networks of interconnected artificial neurons (resulting in a recurrent neural network). The connectionist model is particularly effective for simulating adaptive behaviors, as it can learn and modify its connections based on feedback, much like a biological neural network. In essence, the connectionist approach relies on the Universal Approximation theorem of neural networks to provide a way to optimize towards any kind of rhythmic output. This approach is often employed when the targeted CPG properties cannot be modelled mathematically.\n",
    " \n",
    "On the other hand, the differential equations approach uses mathematical models based on differential equations to simulate the rhythmic outputs of CPGs. This method relies on carefully crafted equations that describe the dynamics of the system, often focusing on the interactions between different elements of the CPG and their temporal evolution. This approach is particularly valued for its precision and predictability, allowing for a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanics of rhythmic patterns. It is widely used in more traditional engineering and robotics contexts, where precise control and predictability are essential. In essence, we can enforce specific properties of rhythmic output we desire though crafting the differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on the latter approach."

    "## Differential equations\n",
    "Before diving into an actual CPG implementation, we will take a brief side step and recap what differential equations are and what they are used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential equations are mathematical equations that describe the relationship between a function and its derivatives. They are fundamental in expressing how a quantity changes over time or space and are pivotal in modeling the behavior of diverse physical, biological, chemical, and economic systems. At their core, differential equations involve functions and their rates of change. For example, in physics, they are used to describe phenomena like the motion of a pendulum or the flow of heat in a solid. In biology, they can model population dynamics or the spread of diseases. In engineering, differential equations are crucial for designing control systems or understanding the behavior of electrical circuits. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of differential equations: ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). ODEs involve functions of a single variable and their derivatives, such as time. PDEs, on the other hand, deal with functions of multiple variables and their partial derivatives, like space and time. Solving a differential equation typically means finding the function or set of functions that satisfy the equation. The solutions can provide vital insights into the behavior of the system being modeled, predicting how it evolves over time or reacts to different conditions. Due to the complexity of many differential equations, solutions are often sought through numerical methods, especially for equations that cannot be solved analytically."

    "### Case study\n",
    "Given our use of physics simulators, we will use a related example. Physics simulators rely on differential equations to accurately represent the dynamics of real-world phenomena. Differential equations enable the simulation of a wide array of physical processes, such as the motion of objects under the influence of forces, fluid dynamics, and even changes in temperature and energy. The motion of objects is often governed by Newton's laws of motion, which are expressed through differential equations. For example, the change in velocity (i.e. the acceleration) of an object is calculated based on the forces applied to it, encapsulating the principles of mass, force, and acceleration. Similarly, in simulating fluid dynamics, the Navier-Stokes equations – a set of nonlinear partial differential equations – are used to describe the motion of fluid substances. These simulators numerically solve these differential equations at discrete time intervals. Ultimately, physics simulators thus solve differential equations to predict the state of the system at a future point in time, given the current state (i.e. the initial/current conditions of the system).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we will solve the differential equations that describe the motion of a point in one-dimensional space. As stated above, the motion of objects is often described by Newton's laws of motion: $F = ma$ (the second law). This law links the force $F$ we apply to an object to its mass $m$ and acceleration $a$. As you you know, acceleration $a$ is the derivative of velocity $v$ with respect to time $t$, which again is the derivative of position $p$ with respect to time. This law can thus be rewritten as $F = ma = m v' = m p''$, where $'$ denotes the derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify things, let's say that in our one-dimensional space, we only have a single force that acts upon the object, which we completely control. We thus know $F(t)$. We will also give our object a mass of 1 such that we can remove it from the above equations: $F = a = v' = p''$. So given a function that describes our force over time $F(t)$, we immediately know what the acceleration $a$ of our point will be. But what if we want to know the velocity over time $v(t)$? Let's work this out with a force function $F(t) = t^2$."

    "Note: the reason why the acceleration function also takes the velocity as an argument, is because the general form of an ODE is $y'(t) = f(t, y(t))$, i.e. the derivative of a function is a function of the independent variable and the function itself. In our case, this means that $a(t) = v'(t) = f'(t, v(t))$. So while we do not explicitly use the velocity in the calculation of our acceleration, let's keep it as an argument anyway to stay general.\n",

This means that the acceleration function describes how our velocity changes over time.

The Euler method is the simplest form of the Runge-Kutta methods and can be considered a first-order Runge-Kutta method. As shown above, it approximates the solution of an ODE by taking a series of steps along the curve, using the slope of the curve (derived from the ODE) at the beginning of each step to predict the value of the function at the next step. The process is akin to taking small, linear steps along the curve, each step based only on the immediate slope. In contrast, higher-order Runge-Kutta methods, such as the popular fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4), take a more sophisticated approach. They use multiple evaluations of the slope (derivative) at various points within each step to make a more accurate prediction for the next value. These methods effectively use additional information about the curvature and behavior of the function within each step to refine their predictions. So at the cost of more function evaluations, it provides better slope approximations.\n",

If we now want to find our point's position $p(t)$ over time, we get the following second-order ODE: $a(t) = p''(t)$. The nice thing is that we can reuse or previous solution to do so! Since we already solved the $a(t) = v'(t)$, we know the (approximated) value of the velocity function $v(t)$. So we can just solve another first order ODE instead: $v(t) = p'(t)$!\n"

    "Now that we refreshed our intuition with respect to using and solving differential equations, we can finally move on to the actual implementation of a CPG. We will implement the CPG model used in a paper by [Sproewitz et al](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364907088401). This CPG model is implemented as a system of $N$ coupled amplitude- and offset-controlled phase oscillators. An oscillator $i$ is defined by the following differential equations (the $\\dot{}$ refers to the derivative operator, which we previously used $`$ for): \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) $\\dot{\\phi_i} = \\omega_i + \\sum_j{w_{ij}r_j}\\sin{(\\phi_j - \\phi_i - \\rho_{ij})}$<br>\n",
    "(2) $\\ddot{r_i} = a_r(\\frac{a_r}{4}(R_i - r_i) - \\dot{r_i})$<br>\n",
    "(3) $\\ddot{x_i} = a_x(\\frac{a_x}{4}(X_i - x_i) - \\dot{x_i})$<br>\n",
    "(4) $\\theta_i = x_i + r_i\\cos{(\\phi_i)}$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta_i$ is the output of the oscillator (in radians) and $\\phi_i$ , $r_i$ and $x_i$ are state variables that respectively encode the phase, amplitude and the offset of the oscillations. The parameters $\\omega_i$ , $R_i$ and $X_i$ are control parameters for the desired frequency, amplitude and offset of the oscillations. The parameters $w_{ij}$ and $\\rho_{ij}$ are respectively the coupling weights and phase biases, which determine how oscillator $j$ influences oscillator $i$. The parameters $a_r$ and $a_x$ are constant positive gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "These equations were designed such that the output of the oscillator $i$ exhibits limit cycle behavior, i.e. produces a stable periodic output. Equation (1) determines the time evolution of the phases of the oscillators, i.e. the phase frequency (\"in which direction and how fast should the phase change?\"). The sum term represents the coupling with other oscillators.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the paper, we will use the same frequency parameter $\\omega_i = \\omega$ for all oscillators, and bi-directional couplings between oscillators such that $\\rho_{ij} = -\\rho_{ji}$. We also ensure that, in case of a closed loop of inter-oscillator couplings, all phase biases in the loop are consistent (i.e. sum to a multiple of $2\\pi$). With these parameters, the phases will converge to a regime in which they grow linearly with a common rate $\\omega$ and with a phase difference between oscillators determined by $\\rho_{ij}$. Equations (2) and (3) are critically damped second-order [linear differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_differential_equation) which respectively have $R_i$ and $X_i$ as stable fixed points. This means that from any initial conditions, the state variables $r_i$ and $x_i$ will asymptotically and monotonically converge to $R_i$ and $X_i$. This allows one to smoothly modulate the amplitude and offset of oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these settings, two oscillators $i$ and $j$ that are coupled with non-zero weights $w_{ij}$ asymptotically converge to limit cycles (i.e. a closed trajectory in the state space that corresponds to sustained oscillations without decay or growth) $\\Theta_i^\\infty$ and $\\Theta_j^\\infty$ with the following closed form (i.e. exact) solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Theta_i^\\infty = X_i + R_i\\cos{(\\omega t + \\rho_{ij} + \\phi_0)}$<br>\n",
    "$\\Theta_j^\\infty = X_j + R_j\\cos{(\\omega t + \\rho_{ji} + \\phi_0)}$<br>\n",
    "where $\\phi_0$ depends on the initial conditions of the system. Note that, because of the common frequency $\\omega$ and phase biases $\\phi_{ij}$ in a loop, this behaviour does not depend on the coupling weights $w_{ij}$. The coupling weights only affect how quickly the system converges: the larger the weights, the faster the convergence. This means that the system stabilizes into oscillations that are phase-locked for all oscillators that are connected together. These oscillations can be modulated (i.e. controlled) by several control parameters, $\\omega$ for setting a common frequency, $\\rho_{ij}$ for setting the phase lags between two connected oscillators, $R_i$ for setting the individual amplitudes and $X_i$ for setting the individual offsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This CPG model has several nice properties:\n",
    "1. The system exhibits limit cycle behavior, i.e. oscillations rapidly return to the steady-state oscillations after any transient perturbation of the state variables\n",
    "2. This limit cycle has a closed form solution. Most types of oscillators used to build CPGs do not have a closed form solution for their limit cycle. The limit cycle has a harmonic shape and has control parameters ($\\omega$, $R_i$ and $X_i$) that are explicit and are directly related to relevant features of the oscillations. This facilitates the design and analysis of locomotion controllers. \n",
    "3. A third interesting property is that these control parameters can be abruptly and/or continuously varied while inducing only smooth changes in the resulting oscillations (i.e. there are no discontinuities nor jerks). This property is important in avoiding damage in the motors and gearboxes of robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now implement this model for a system with 2 bi-directionally coupled oscillators in JAX. We will implement this using a functional CPG class and a datastructures for the CPG's state. "

    "Cool! Looking at the CPG outputs, we can indeed see that our oscillators (1) converge to a limit cycle (steady-state oscillations), even though we have random initial conditions, (2) the two oscillators indeed converge to the given target amplitudes $R_0=1$ and $R_1=0.5$, (3) the two oscillators indeed converge to the given target offsets $X_0=1$ and $X_1=-1$, and (4)  the two oscillators indeed exhibit our requested phase lag $\\pi$, making them run in anti-phase. The latter is also demonstrated by the phases plot. We can see that the phase difference between the two oscillators converges to our phase bias setting: $\\pi$, i.e. $\\rho_{12} = \\pi$ and $\\rho_{21} = -\\pi$. Due to the definition of the oscillator couplings in Equation $(1)$ above, this causes the oscillator one to decrease its phase frequency, and oscillator two to increase its phase frequency, until the desired bias (i.e. difference between them) of $\\pi$ is met. \n",

Instead, we'll just use two bi-directionally connected oscillators per arm: one for the IP motion and one for the OOP motion. We can then just map the output of an oscillator to all its respective joints in the arm (i.e. the IP oscillator's output is mapped to all IP joints of that arm, and the same thing for the OOP oscillator and the OOP joints). Given that we have 5 arms and 2 oscillators per arm, we thus have a total of $5 \\times 2 = 10$ oscillators.

    "A [brittle star's rowing gait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8UEST-flCM) divides the arms in roughly two roles: (1) one leading arm that points towards the direction of motion, and (2) rowers that pull the brittle star forwards. We will try to module our CPG in such a way that we can reproduce this behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the leading arm, this comes down to:\n",
    "- Setting its IP and OOP oscillator's amplitude $R$ to zero in order to inhibit oscillatory motion.\n",
    "    - Given that we inhibit the leading arms oscillatory motions, we can just set its coupling phase biases to zero as well.\n",
    "- Setting the offset $X$ of its IP oscillator to zero to make it point forwards.\n",
    "- Setting the offset $X$ if its OOP oscillator to a positive value to make it point upwards. This will avoid the leading arm sliding on the ground and creating unnecessary friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rowing arms, it is a bit more complex. For each rowing arm:\n",
    "- We will set its amplitudes $R$ to the maximum joint range of motion, such that our output signal oscillates the joint between this maximum and minimum range of motion.\n",
    "- We will set the IP and OOP offset $X$ to zero to make oscillations center around zero.\n",
    "- We will set their coupling phase biases $\\rho$ in such a way that their IP and OOP oscillators produce a circular motion of the arm. As discussed above, can be done by incorporating a phase bias of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ between the IP and OOP oscillator.\n",
    "    - Arms on the right of the leading arm will need to follow a counterclockwise direction, while arms on the left of the leading arm need to follow a clockwise direction.\n",
    "    - Let's say that for some rowing arm, our IP oscillator has index $x$ and our OOP oscillator has index $y$:\n",
    "        - To create a counterclockwise motion, the above test shows that we need $\\phi_{y} = \\phi_{x} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This means that we'll need to set $\\rho_{xy} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\rho_{yx} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. (If this confuses you, take another look at our very first CPG test and its corresponding phase plot.)\n",
    "        - To create a clockwise motion, the above test shows that we need $\\phi_{y} = \\phi_{x} + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This means that we'll need to set $\\rho_{xy} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\rho_{yx} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we connected the oscillators of neighbouring arms, we also need to set the phase biases of their couplings. For the OOP oscillators, this is easy. All OOP oscillators should be perfectly synchronized (all rowing arms should go up and down at the same time), so we can set their phase biases to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coupling between the IP oscillators of the two hind rowers (i.e. the second left rower and the second right rower) however needs adaptation. These were shifted in opposite directions by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ due to the coupling with their respective OOP oscillators. This means that, without adaptation, this loop would have a phase bias sum of $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\pi$ (when we do this summation check of bi-directional couplings, we only take the positive direction into account). Consequently, in order to obtain a sum of $2\\pi$, we need to set the phase bias between these IP oscillators to $\\pi$. More specifically, if $l$ is the index of the left rower's IP oscillator and $r$ is the index of the right rower's IP oscillator, we get $\\rho_{lr} = \\pi$ and $\\rho_{rl} = -\\pi$. Intuitively, we want the IP oscillators of the left and right rower to run in anti-phase, which requires a phase bias of $\\pi$ between both oscillators.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further clarity, the following drawing visualises the phase biases of all couplings:\n",
    "![](assets/cpg_phase_biases.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It might be a bit tough to understand the reasoning behind the choices of phase biases and especially whether $\\rho_{ij}$ or $\\rho_{ji}$ should be negative. Whenever in doubt: play some more with phase biases using the simple 2-oscillator model from above and look at the corresponding output and phase plots!"

    "Awesome, by exploiting our prior knowledge on brittle star rowing behaviour and by making simplifications in our CPG system, we can manually define quite a decent gait for our brittle star robot! In applications where we cannot manually define the modulation parameters, we often apply optimization algorithms to solve this problem for us. For instance, we can optimize the modulation parameters to make the robot crawl as fast as possible or even to try to discover as many distinct gaits as possible. Optimization also allows us to scale up the number of oscillators (e.g. to the number of actuators). This gives the CPG more degrees of freedom to work with, allowing it to produce more complex behaviours than our current circular motions."
