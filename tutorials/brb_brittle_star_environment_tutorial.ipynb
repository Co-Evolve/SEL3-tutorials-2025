As shown below, this happens in a similar manner for both the MJC and the MJX variants, as both follow the interface defined in [moojoco](https://github.com/Co-Evolve/moojoco/blob/main/moojoco/environment/base.py). This interface follows the functional programming paradigm. Put simply, this means that we rely only on pure functions (i.e. functions that are deterministic and without side effects). Consequently, when interacting with the environment, we will always have an explicit environment state that is passed around (instead of relying on the environment to adapt its state). The main difference between the MJC and MJX variants is that the MJC variant uses [MJCEnvState](https://github.com/Co-Evolve/moojoco/blob/main/moojoco/environment/mjc_env.py#L29) (which contains Numpy arrays and Numpy's random states), while the MJX variant uses [MJXEnvState](https://github.com/Co-Evolve/moojoco/blob/main/moojoco/environment/mjx_env.py#L58) (which contains JAX arrays and JAX's random number generators).\n",

    "- `truncated`: boolean value that denotes whether the episode was truncated (e.g. because the time limit was reached)\n",
    "- `reward`: float value that denotes the reward of doing the given actions in the previous state\n",
    "- `info`: a dictionary that the environment can use to pass additional information to the user\n",

To parallelize, it just adds an additional batch dimension over these arrays via [jax.vmap](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/03-vectorization.html). When vectorizing over the GPU, we often run one environment instance per CUDA core available (this can be found on your GPU's datasheet).
