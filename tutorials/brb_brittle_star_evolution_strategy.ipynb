    "This notebook provides an introductory tutorial to Evolution Strategies (ES). Specifically, we will apply the [OpenAI-ES](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03864) algorithm to optimise the gait of a brittle star robot. The [brittle star robot and its environment](https://github.com/Co-Evolve/brt/tree/main/biorobot/brittle_star) is part of the [**the Bio-inspired Robotics Testbed (BRT)**](https://github.com/Co-Evolve/brt). Instead of directly evolving joint-level actions, we will evolve modulation parameters for a Central Pattern Generator, that in turn outputs the joint-level actions."

    "# Case study: Evolving CPG modulation parameters for brittle star locomotion\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolution strategies are a type of black-box optimizer that are particularly effective for optimizing continuous parameters. To apply these strategies, two essential components are required: first, a clear definition of a candidate solution—essentially a list of parameters representing a potential answer to the optimization problem—and second, an evaluation function that can assess the performance of each candidate solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we utilize the OpenAI-ES algorithm to optimize the modulation parameters of a Central Pattern Generator (CPG), with the objective of enabling the brittle star robot to move as far from its starting position as possible. The CPG system employed here is the same as the one described in the CPG tutorial, which consists of a network of $N$ coupled oscillators controlled by both amplitude and offset parameters. Each arm of the brittle star is actuated by two oscillators—one managing the in-plane motions and another responsible for the out-of-plane motions, with the outputs shared across all segments of the arm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topology of the CPG is illustrated in the accompanying diagram below. Rather than manually defining the phase biases between oscillators to achieve a rowing-like behavior, this notebook optimizes these phase biases along with other parameters. Here we thus deviate from the CPG and Q-Learning tutorials, in the sense that we do not manually define CPG parameters based on biological observations, but rather optimise it completely. Specifically, the parameters subject to optimization include a single shared frequency ($\\omega$);, for each oscillator, an amplitude ($R$) and an offset ($X$); and for each coupling between oscillators, a phase bias ($\\rho_{ij}$), where the biases satisfy the condition $\\rho_{ij} = -\\rho_{ji}$ as described in the CPG tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the system comprises 10 oscillators and 15 bi-directional couplings, the overall optimization problem involves tuning a total of $1 + (10 \\times 2) + (15 \\times 1) = 36$ parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that we are evolving an open-loop controller, meaning that the controller is non-adaptive and does not incorporate sensory feedback to modify its operation in real-time. Later in the project, you will close the loop and for instance optimise a seperate ANN to output CPG modulations based on sensory inputs.\n",

Mitigate this by clipping the values of the candidate solutions to $[-1, 1]$ using [EvoParams](https://github.com/RobertTLange/evosax/blob/cae0e9271794f4702ba16a8c6fcaaf8595f4a2f3/evosax/strategies/open_es.py#L28).
